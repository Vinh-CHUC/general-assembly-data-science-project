    "\n",
    "### 5.A Renaming some columns for class balance\n",
    "If we look at the data that we have, the players are already labelled as \"Winner\" and \"Loser\". Obviously the \"Winner\" player always win so we can't just fit a model using the \"does the player in the Winner column\" wins as they all do!\n",
    "We'd have to somehow, for every observation assign one player to be \"Player1\" and the other to be \"Player2\" such that Player1 doesn't always win on our dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.B Working with time series\n",
    "\n",
    "I am not yet very familiar about how to compute time series related features. I'll probably be using the pandas **rolling** method for example\n",
    "There's probably quite some work around extracting/transforming data to reach the state where I have independant observations, but I'm confident I'll get there\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.C Quality of the derived features\n",
    "This is the heart of this project really, hopefully it is possible to relatively easily guess features that will contribute to the quality of the prediction, but I don't have any certainty there.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.D Is the data enough?\n",
    "Two things here:\n",
    "* I decided not to use more fine-grained data about the tennis games (for example the % of 1st serves, of aces etc.) but chose to stay at a relatively high level ie looking at when players win and in what conditions (versus whom, in which tournament, type of surface etc.)\n",
    "* So there there is a risk that this data doesn't actually capture enough knowledge to produce good predictions\n",
    "* Even if I was using that additional data, even then there's always factors which won't be captured in the data (the psychology of the players on the day, their actual style, the strategy that they decided to use on the day etc.) In essence we're trying here to predict the interaction between two human beings and we'll have never have \"all the data\" to model the situation here.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more specific concern here is that the **ATP Rank** of the players is alreay a very good predictor (ie the better ranked player should win) and that it might be difficult to beat it. I guess there's two approaches here:\n",
    "* Consider the **ATP Rank** as the baseline, and try to incorporate more features to further increase the quality of that baseline modle\n",
    "* Ignore **ATP Rank** and try to predict the winner with \"my own\" features\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.E Is the data correct?\n",
    "Given that the dataset is relatively popular on Kaggle, I would assume this it is mostly correct. I might still double check that a given player's name is always spelled the same way throughout all of the observations, otherwise the historical features could be wrong!"

   "cell_type": "markdown",

    "## 6/ Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "I expect the model to be relatively complex, crafting various features which are not correlated, experimenting in a lot of different ways etc. I might also derived non-linear features (ie the product of two features) to enhance the model.\n",
    "The very model itself will hopefully be a simple logistic regression so the complexity will probably be more on the features engineering side.\n",
    "\n",
    "As said above success could be defined in several different ways:\n",
    "* I've been able to increase the baseline (ATP Rank based predictor) substantially by incorporating new features\n",
    "* If the Rank alone is already too good, then achieving a \"good enough\" accuracy, hopefully quite close to the baseline of the ATP Ranks (65%) would qualify as success?\n",
    "\n",
    "If the project goes bust, I guess this would mean that the accuracy score won't be very good... But I will have been through the whole process anyway, so maybe the actual score isn't that important in the end?"
